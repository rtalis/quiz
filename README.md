# Estratificação social quiz
This is a quiz i've done in ~2017, just for fun and for applying some learning about java. I'll fix some things to make the code clear, but it is mostly fun see the way to solve issues in a new language when you're learning how to program.

The quiz is about estratificação social, some questions for the final of an presentation using two groups to compete for a prize.
